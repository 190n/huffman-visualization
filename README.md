huffman-visualization
=====================

This is a visualizaiton of [Huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding). It builds the Huffman tree using a WASM module (compiled from C code) and displays it using HTML5 Canvas. It also shows the raw histogram.

**Note:** Unfortunately, the C code implementing Huffman coding is _not_ currently public, as it was written for a class assignment. Once this class is over, I will push the source code.
